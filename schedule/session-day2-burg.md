In order to minimize deployment time, Neocles adopted a build-once, deploy-many strategy.

This allowed us to develop an app from a single code base and deliver it to four of our global customers in 24(!) distinct apps (including three environments for iOS and Android for each customer).

In this talk, I will talk about how we did this and will go in-depth on some of the bigger learnings we had through the process.
