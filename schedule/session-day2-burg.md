In order to minimize deployment time, Neocles adopted a build-once, deploy-many strategy.
It allowed them to develop their app from a single code base and deliver it to four of their global customers in 24 distinct apps (including three environments for iOS and Android for each customer)

Bart will talk about how they did this and will go in-depth on some of the bigger learnings they had in the process.
