Did you ever notice that the Vue community is populated by musicians, artists, and teachers? Why is this? Is there something about this framework that appeals to admirers and practitioners of the visual and plastic arts? In this talk I’ll explore ways in which the familiar patterns of Vue development translate to some aspects of traditional Chinese brush painting, going on a romp through one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world and seeing how some of its tenets can inspire us, as developers, and inform the way we write our code. We’ll then take a look at how to build a web and mobile app that exist in perfect harmony, creating a piece of artwork collaboratively.
