We will kick the day with a quick overview of the NativeScript Roadmap. We can’t know where we are going if we don’t know where we are. Therefore, Emil will start with a summary of where the product stands today, quickly dashing into the more exciting stuff - what’s next? After this talk you will have a clear picture of the scope of the next releases as well as the long-term vision for the product. All of this will come straight from the source, spiced up with the thinking of the engineering team.
