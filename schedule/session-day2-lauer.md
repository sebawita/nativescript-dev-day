Progress (the company behind the open source NativeScript framework), is set to release a new product that enables low code development of NativeScript apps for iOS and Android + a web app from the same codebase. Using tried-and-true code sharing strategies with Angular, and relying on the robust serverless platform of Progress Kinvey, Kinvey Studio is the next generation of "high productivity" tooling that lets you drag-and-drop your way to building apps, in a developer-approved manner.
