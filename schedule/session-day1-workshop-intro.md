Join our instructors for an all-day workshop on NativeScript. In this workshop you’ll learn what NativeScript is, how it works, and how to use the framework to build iOS and Android apps. Then, you’ll dive in and use NativeScript to build an iOS and Android app from scratch. If haven’t yet learned Angular, you’ll learn fundamental concepts while we go along.

You will bring your own mobile device and laptop, with the software being discussed installed, and have the unique opportunity to learn hands-on, following along with an instructor step-by-step. Please, come with NativeScript installed on your development machine and ready to go. The price is only €30 + booking fees and seating is very limited.

Come learn how to build native apps with Angular!
