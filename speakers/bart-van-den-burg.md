After finishing his studies of Slavic Languages and Cultures of all things, Bart van den Burg decided to go back to his original passion of programming. Five years ago he crossed paths with Neocles, where he started as a Frontend developer using AngularJS. In the meantime he has grown out to be the lead developer, dealing with all facets of building their SaaS service in Azure, but still mostly deals with frontend work, in which position he started the migration project to NativeScript.

A family man with two young kids at home and a lead developer at work, two responsibilities he carries with passion. Any free time he has left outside of that he loves to spend shooting at the range, travelling and running.
