Alex is the Team Lead of the NativeScript Core team. He is a core NativeScript contributor and a music enthusiast. He loves talking about coding, so he also co-organizes the Angular Sofia meetup. He believes that after a whole day of writing dirty hacks - you should at least spend the evening with fellow coders, talking about pure functions.
